For most questions about certbot, and all questions about Let’s Encrypt, it’s best to start with the [Let’s Encrypt Community Forums](https://community.letsencrypt.org/) (these are hosted by [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)).

If you have a technical bug report, you can file it against the [certbot github issue tracker](https://www.github.com/certbot/certbot/issues).  Be sure to search for related issues first!

Our community can be contacted on IRC on the #certbot and #certbot-dev channels on irc.OFTC.net

Or [file an issue on github](https://www.github.com/certbot/certbot/issues).
