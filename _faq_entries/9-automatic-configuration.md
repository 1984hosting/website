title:  "Will Certbot support automated configuration of my web server?"

We intend to launch Certbot with support for automated configuration of recent versions of Apache and Nginx. We are hoping to have automated configuration support for Windows IIS ready at launch as well. The automated configuration makes it fast and easy to obtain, install, and automatically renew certificates.

If automated configuration is not supported for your web server, you can still get a certificate using Certbot and configure your server software manually. In this case, the certificate will not be renewed automatically.

Note that automated configuration is not required. It can be disabled if you prefer to configure your server software yourself.
