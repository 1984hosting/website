<p>
Certbot has a fairly solid beta-quality Apache plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:
</p>
<pre>{{base_command}} --apache</pre>
<p>
If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Apache configuration by hand, you can do use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>{{base_command}} --apache certonly</pre>

    <blockquote><aside>
        Note: the apache plugin with <tt>certonly</tt> does the following:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>make temporary config changes<br>
          (adding a new vhost to pass an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02#section-7.3">ACME Challenge</a>, and enabling <tt>mod_ssl</tt> if necessary)</li>
          <li>performs a graceful reload</li>
          <li>reverts all changes</li>
          <li>performs another graceful reload</li>
        </ol>
        This appears to be a reliable process, but if you don't want Certbot
        to touch your Apache process or files in any way, you can use the
        <a
        href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot">webroot plugin</a>.
