        Are you ok with temporarily stopping your website?

    <h3>Yes, my web server is not currently running on this machine.</h3>
    <p>
        Stop your webserver, then run this command to get a certificate.
        Certbot will temporarily spin up a webserver on your machine.
        <pre>
            sudo certbot certonly --standalone
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h3>No, I need to keep my web server running.</h3>
    <p>
        If you have a webserver that's already using port 80 and don't want to stop it
        while Certbot runs, run this command and follow the instructions in the terminal.
        <pre>
            sudo certbot certonly --webroot
        </pre>

            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
