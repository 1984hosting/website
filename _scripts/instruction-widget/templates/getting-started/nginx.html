<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a
    href="/docs/contributing.html#running-a-local-copy-of-the-client">follow
    the developer instructions</a> to run Certbot with Nginx support from git
    master.
