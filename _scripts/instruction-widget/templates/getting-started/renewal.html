<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

Let's Encrypt certificates last for 90 days, so it's highly advisable to
renew them automatically! You can test automatic renewal for your certificates
by running this command:

<pre>
{{base_command}} renew --dry-run {{#xenial}}--agree-tos{{/xenial}}
</pre>

{{#xenial}}
There's a bug in the version of Certbot on Ubuntu Xenial which may show a warning
saying 'Registering without email!' evn if you have previously given an email to
Certbot. Don't worry if this happens, it will not effect your renewal.
{{/xenial}}

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>{{base_command}} renew {{#above_4}}--quiet {{/above_4}}{{#cbauto}}--no-self-upgrade{{/cbauto}}</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>
