<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
{{#cron_included}}
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
{{/cron_included}}
{{^cron_included}}
Certbot can be configured to
{{/cron_included}}
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo {{base_command}} renew --dry-run
</pre>

{{^cron_included}}
If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>{{base_command}} renew</pre>
{{/cron_included}}

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>
