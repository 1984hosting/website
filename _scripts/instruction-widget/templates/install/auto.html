<p>
Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a packaged version of certbot you should use our certbot-auto script to get a copy:
</p>
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/certbot/certbot
$ cd certbot
$ ./certbot-auto --help
</pre>
<p>
certbot-auto accepts the same flags as certbot; it installs all of its own dependencies and updates the client code automatically (but itâ€™s comparatively slow and large in order to achieve that)
</p>
