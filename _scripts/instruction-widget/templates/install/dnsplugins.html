Certbot's DNS plugins are also available for your system which can be used to
automate obtaining a wildcard certificate from Let's Encrypt's ACMEv2 server.
To use one of these plugins, you must have configured DNS for the domain you
want to obtain a certificate for with a DNS provider that Certbot has a plugin
for. A list of these plugins and more information about using them can be found
<a href="/docs/using.html#dns-plugins">here</a>. To install one of these
plugins, run the installation command above but replace {{package}} with the
name of the DNS plugin you want to install.

Certbot's DNS plugins which can be used to automate obtaining a wildcard
certificate from Let's Encrypt's ACMEv2 server are not available for your OS
yet. This should change soon but if you don't want to wait, you can use these
plugins now by
<a href="/docs/install.html#running-with-docker">running Certbot in Docker</a>
instead of using the instructions on this page.
