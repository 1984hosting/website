## Want to help Certbot?

There are lots of ways to contribute to Certbot.

For many of them, you’ll want to come chat with us on [the Certbot channel](https://opensource.eff.org/eff-open-source/channels/certbot) in [EFF’s Mattermost instance for its open source projects](https://opensource.eff.org/signup_user_complete/?id=6iqur37ucfrctfswrs14iscobw) as described below.

You can get involved with several of EFF's software projects such as Certbot at the [EFF Open Source Contributor Chat Platform](https://opensource.eff.org/signup_user_complete/?id=6iqur37ucfrctfswrs14iscobw).
