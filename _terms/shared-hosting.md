Shared hosting is a kind of web hosting in which several customers’ web sites are hosted by the same server, which is mainly administered by the web hosting provider. Usually customers administer their own sites on a shared server using a web-based control panel interface. This is less expensive than VPS hosting and often calls for less technical knowledge on the customer’s part; overall, it’s the most popular type of web hosting environment. 
Certbot is less suitable for use in most shared hosting environments because it’s usually easier and more reliable to ask the hosting provider to set up HTTPS. (Some shared hosting users use Certbot, most often because their hosting providers are uncooperative or don’t have another way to enable HTTPS support for customer sites.)
