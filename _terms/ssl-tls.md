SSL, aka TLS, is a protocol used to encrypt data sent between two computers. When you browse the web with encryption using HTTPS (instead of HTTP), your web browser is using SSL/TLS to talk to web sites under the hood. Sometimes SSL and TLS are used to distinguish different protocol versions, but for most common purposes they are synonyms.
