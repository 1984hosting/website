DNS is the Domain Name System which creates a worldwide directory of domain names, like example.com, certbot.eff.org, community.letsencrypt.org, or millions of others. These domain names can be looked up by Internet users’ software anywhere in the world to learn IP addresses and other technical data that’s used to make connections to servers. DNS is an important part of Internet infrastructure and is operated collectively by hundreds of organizations, including DNS registrars (which let you pay to register your own domain name for your own site) and various DNS providers.
