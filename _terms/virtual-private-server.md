A virtual private server is a complete server environment within which the customer can control the entire operating system and software environment. That allows the customer to be the system administrator for this server environment. This is the second-most common kind of web hosting environment (following shared hosting), and is offered by major providers like Amazon AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, and Linode, among others. 
Most successful Certbot users are running Certbot in a VPS environment.
