Let’s Encrypt is a certificate authority that issues digital certificates free of charge to let people get encrypted HTTPS connections to web sites on the Internet, which are substantially more secure than unencrypted connections. 
Certbot is a software tool made by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Certbot is the most popular way for people who run their own web servers to get a Let’s Encrypt certificate, set up HTTPS on the server, and renew the certificate automatically in the future. There are also many other tools and options for people in different situations to get Let’s Encrypt certificates.
