A command line is a way of interacting with a computer by typing text-based commands to it and receiving text-based replies. 
Certbot is run from a command-line interface, usually on a Unix-like server. In order to use Certbot for most purposes, youâ€™ll need to be able to install and run it on the command line of your web server, which is usually accessed over SSH.
