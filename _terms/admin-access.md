You have administrative access to a server if you are the person who can control that server and perform administrative tasks like installing and removing software or changing the system as a whole. This is often also called “root access.” If you can successfully run “sudo” on a server, you have admin access. This is probably the case if you use a VPS or dedicated server or if someone else has set up the server just for you. It’s probably not the case if you use a shared server or if you can only ever interact with the server via FTP, SFTP, or a control panel interface.
