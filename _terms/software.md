Software is a set of instructions that teach a computer how to perform a particular task. 
Certbot is one software application that can be useful for web site administrators who want to set up HTTPS on their web sites. Certbot documentation will also expect you to know the names and versions of some other software that you use on your web server. For instance, the way to install Certbot is different on different operating systems, so you'll be asked the operating system software that your web server uses.
