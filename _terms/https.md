HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the update to HTTP that uses the SSL/TLS protocol to provide security for connections between web browsers and web servers. Using HTTPS normally requires a certificate from a certificate authority, such as Letâ€™s Encrypt, and will also require installing that certificate onto a web server. 
Certbot can help perform both of these steps automatically in many cases. HTTPS is an Internet standard and is normally used with TCP port 443.
